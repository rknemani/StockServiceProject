# StockServiceProject

#This project's purpose was to develop an API to read stock account information

The Stock Account API must allow users to:

• Retrieve a list of stock accounts

• Retrieve a stock account by id

• Retrieve a stock account by name

◦ If there's more than one stock account holder with the same name, then return the first matching account.

◦ If there's no matching account, then return null.

◦ Do not return a collection of stock accounts. Only return back a single stock account.
